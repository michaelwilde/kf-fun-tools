# Draft LinkedIn Post: For Engineers: An API to Decode Sales Conversations

Attention engineers and technical leaders: Ever feel like sales calls are a foreign language exercise? ðŸ’» ðŸ¤”

As a former engineer, now head of sales (and closet vibe-coder), I know engineers just want to see the demo. Problem is: no one ever teaches technical folks how to decode sales conversations or why we ask the questions we do

**So we built something I wish I'd had years ago: Sales processes as an API** ðŸ§ª

ðŸ‘‰ Check it out here: https://kloudfuse.com/tools/salesapi

We've created a mock API documentation site that translates sales methodologies into the format YOU work with daily. No, it's not a real API to callâ€”it's a decoder ring that helps you understand what's happening in those sales meetings and how to navigate them efficiently.

Built for engineers, by engineers:
- Sales processes as RESTful endpoints you can mentally "call"
- Decision criteria as structured JSON (not vague sales speak)
- Business case frameworks with clear input/output parameters
- Examples showing how to translate your technical achievements into terms that unlock budget

The goal? Stop wasting your time in circular sales conversations. We're meeting you where YOU are, rather than expecting you to become sales experts.

For my engineering colleagues:
1. Would this approach help you get through sales conversations more efficiently?
2. What other parts of the sales process would you like to see "documented" this way?
3. How else can we make vendor interactions less painful for you?

This is an experiment in respecting your time and expertise. Because you shouldn't need a translator to have productive conversations about tools that could actually help your team.

I'm especially interested in feedback from technical leaders who interface with vendors regularly. What other parts of the sales process would you like to see "documented" this way?

And for my sales colleagues: Could this approach help you have more productive conversations with technical teams? Would structuring our discovery and sales process as API documentation make it easier to connect with engineers on their terms?
